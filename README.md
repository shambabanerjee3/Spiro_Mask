Firstly Recorded the Breadthing with microphone and then conveted in mp3 and wav as it would required.
Next in sample_rate.py file use built in python open() function to read the WAV file and 25th byte of the file sample rate information is stored , so went to that position using seek() function and after getting the information simply print the value, and in my case i am getting 164Hz.
In spectogram.py file first import necessary libraries. librosa is used for audio processing, matplotlib for plotting, and numpy for numerical operations.Then Load the audio file using librosa.load(). The sr=None argument means that librosa should not resample the audio, and it should keep the original sample rate. The loaded audio data and sample rate are stored in the variables audio_data and sample_rate, respectively.Then Compute the Mel spectrogram using librosa.feature.melspectrogram(). This function calculates the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and maps the resulting spectrum to the Mel scale. The parameters like n_fft (number of FFT points), hop_length (hop size between consecutive frames), and n_mels (number of Mel bins) influence the computation.Convert the power spectrogram to decibels using librosa.power_to_db().Create a figure, display the spectrogram using librosa.display.specshow(), and customize the plot. The color bar indicates the intensity in decibels. The x_axis is time, and the y_axis is the Mel scale. Finally, show the plot.
